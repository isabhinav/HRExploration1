#### _Unveiling Insights to Foster Workforce Sustainability and Development_


## Introduction
Maintaining a skilled and satisfied workforce is crucial for any organization aiming for long-term success. With rising competition for talent and increasing employee expectations, organizations must continuously evolve their understanding of employee demographics, compensation, and satisfaction. 

In this project, we use exploratory data analysis techniques in R to uncover insights into the company's compensation practices, workforce diversity, and demographic structure. The aim of the project is to provide actionable intelligence that can inform strategic HR and business decisions.

## Problem Statement
